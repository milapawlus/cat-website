            <h3>Information about cats</h3>
            <p>
                Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don't taste sweetness.
                Cats are nearsighted, but their peripheral vision and night vision are much better than that of humans.
                Cats are supposed to have 18 toes (five toes on each front paw; four toes on each back paw).
                Cats can jump up to six times their length.

                <br>
                <br>

                The average lifespan for a pet cat is probably around 13 to 14 years.
                 However, although their lifespan varies,
                 a well cared for cat may commonly live to 15 or beyond,
                 some make it to 18 or 20 and a few extraordinary felines even pass 25 or 30 years of age.

            <p>
                The <b>Maine Coon</b> is the largest of all cat breeds and has a muscular body and
                sturdy legs. The head has a square muzzle and large ears, which are wide at the
                base and set high. The long and thick coat consists of underwool covered with
                glossy, waterproof overcoat. The fur is shorter on the head, neck and shoulders
                and longer on the back, sides and tail. On the belly and hind legs, the fur is
                thick and shaggy. The neck collar is stronger on males than on females. The tail
                is long and bushy and the ears have tufts on the tip. The fur on the paws has a
                "snowshoe" effect. The Maine coon comes in thirty or more colors. The eyes can
                be green, gold or copper colored; white cats can have blue or different colored
                eyes.

        <section class="description" id="ragdoll">
            <p>
                The <b>Ragdoll</b>  is a large, powerful and impressive breed with a distinctive
                pattern. However, it is an incredibly calm and relaxed cat that gives the
                impression of a ragdoll ("ragdoll" in English). The broad head is flat on top and
                the ears are set far apart. The eyes are deep blue and large. The body is long and
                muscular with a broad chest, short neck and robust legs. The tufted paws are large
                and round, and the tail is long and bushy. The Ragdoll's thick coat is silky and
                medium to long, and adult cats should have a collar and long hair on their hind
                legs. Ragdoll can have three different fur patterns and each pattern is available
                in four colors. There is also a type that has extra white markings on the paws,
                chin and chest.

        <section class="description" id="bengal">
            <p>
                The <b>Bengal</b> cat is a domesticated cat breed created from hybrids of domestic
                cats, especially the spotted Egyptian Mau, with the Asian leopard cat
                (Prionailurus bengalensis). The breed name comes from the leopard cat's
                taxonomic name. Bengals have a wild appearance; their golden shimmer comes
                from their leopard cat ancestry, and their coats may show spots, rosettes,
                arrowhead markings, or marbling. They are an energetic breed which needs
                much exercise and play.

        <section class="description" id="british">
            <p>
                The <b>British</b> shorthair cat is a medium-to-large-sized cat breed with a short,
                dense coat and a distinctive rounded head and face that make it look a lot like
                a cuddly teddy bear. The British shorthair cat is sweet and affectionate without
                being needy or clingy. This breed hails from the United Kingdom where it developed
                naturally and was the regio's original domestic shorthaired cat. Originally, many
                British shorthairs were blue colored (a gray hue), but today's British shorthair
                comes in a veritable rainbow of colors and patterns, including solid, bicolor,
                tabby, tortoiseshell, calico, and more.
